# Circuit-Simulator
This application solves electrical circuits using AC sinusoidal frequency domain analysis. which means it calculates:

* Nodal voltages for every node.
* Voltage difference on each element.
* Current through each element .
* Power supplied and/or power dissipated for each element in the circuit.
